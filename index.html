    Google Drive web hosting server:<br>
    More file hosting storage space for the website so it uses less of the limited-availability free disk space.
    <!--
    access any publicly shared googledrive files and folders as if they where hosted on this server.
    <br><br>
    NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR DAMAGES CAUSED BY CONTENT OR PAGES ACCESSED THROUGH /f.php/ BECAUSE IT IS A PROXY FOR GOOGLEDRIVE. THE CONTENT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE UPLOADER WHO UPLOADED IT TO OR OTHERWISE STORED IT OR SHARED IT ON GOOGLE-DRIVE.
    <br><br>
    NOTE: In this explanation I use square brackets "[]" to represent non-literal values (a string that you must supply to use).<br>
    <br>
    usage: /f.php/[shared folder/file id]/path/to/file.html
    <br>

    examples:
    <br><br>
    <a href="/./gd/f.php/pic/">/f.php/pic/</a>
    <br>
    <br>
    <a href="/./gd/f.php/Galaxies.html">/f.php/Galaxies.html</a>
    <br>
    <br>
    <!-- not available here because this only allows one gd folder root id
    Alias feature:<br>
    /f.php?alias=[anyname]:[shared folder/file id]<br>
    Set alternate names for [shared folder/file ids]<br>
    NOTE: No spaces (whitespace) or commas or simicolins allowed in alias names.<br>
    Alias names must be at least 5 characters long.<br>
    Alias names and id values are case-sensitive.</br>
    It works using http cookies so it must be set individually for each client.<br>
    It's possible to use an index.html webpage stored in a shared folder accessed with /f.php/[shared folder id]
    or use the html file's id, and in that html file you could have a javascript redirect that sets the cookie
    document.cookie="gd_alias_[alias name]=[shared file/folder id];path=/f.php/";
    or you could use XHR with the f.php?alias=[] method.
    use "?alias=[]&httponly=1" for setting httpOnly cookies.

    /f.php/[shared folder id]/path/to/file.jpeg/dscr.txt<br>
    Append "/dscr.txt" to the end of any file path to see that Google-Drive file's description attribute if it has one.<br>
    User "/dscr.json" or "/dscr.html" to get JSON or HTML formatted descriptions.
